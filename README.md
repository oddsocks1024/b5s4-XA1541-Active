## 3D Printable Case
A 3D printable case specifically designed for this PCB is also available. STLs are included in this repo and there is also a [Thingiverse Page](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7099785)

* Designed to use screws as they produce a much nicer, more robust case
* 4 x 3.5mm self-tapping screws to attach the shells. Max length about 12mm
